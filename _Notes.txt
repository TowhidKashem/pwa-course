IndexDB:

  - Key value pair transactional database
    - If it's a file store in cache
    - If it's dynamic data store in IndexDB
    - Transactional means if one field of a DB update operation fails to write then the whole query fails to maintain DB integrity

  - Is async (things like local and session storage are syncronous) therefore it can be used in servie workers, local and session storage cannot

  - Can have multiple databases but it's typical to have one per app with as many tables as needed

  - Wide browser support
